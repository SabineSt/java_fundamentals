Answer the following questions:


1.) What are the names and uses of Java's eight primitive types?

    byte  the size of 8 bit
    short
    integer whole numbers  max size 32 bits
    long  whole numbers  max size 64 bits
    float floating point number  max size 32 bits; (can have 6 digits after the point, needs f at end to be recognized because automatically f. no. are recognized as doubles from system...)
    double floating point number  max size 64 bits (can have like 15 digits after the point)
    char  character
    boolean  holds two possible values: true or false

2.) How do you declare and initialize an int variable called "x" with the value 42.

    int x = 42;

3.) What happens if you initialize a double variable with the value of an int?

    a .0 is going to be written to the whole number at the output, size is widened

4.) How do you set an int variable to the value of a double?

    int x;
    double y = x;

5.) What are the 5 arithmetic operators?

    +
    -
    *
    /
    %

6.) What are Relational operators used for? What is the result of using a relational operator?

    the result is a boolean.
    until now we have used them as conditions in loops or conditional statements, 'ifs'.

7.) Demonstrate the use of a Relational operator.

    if(x > 5) System.out.println("x is higher than 5");

8.) What logical operators used for? What is the result of using a logical operator?

    to broaden the possibility or range of conditions

9.) Demonstrate the use of a logical operator.

    if(x < 5 && x > 0) System.out.println("Print this.");

10.) How can you use the shorthand addition operator to add 10 to a variable "x"?

    x += 10;

11.) What data type is a String?

    its an object type

12.) Are string mutable?

    once published (?) they are not (does published mean, given a value, initialized?)

13.) How do you concatenate Strings?

    +
    String x = "Hello";
    String y = "World";
    (x + " " + y)


14.) Can you cast an int to a String or a String to an int? Why or why not?

    i dont think so, because the casting is used for primitive types and String is an object type
    but chars can be casted to int and vicavers

15.) What is an array?

    a collection of data, one form of collection

16.) What is the first index of an array?

    0

17.) Can you change the size of an array once it has been declared and initialized?

    no

18.) How do you print the 5th element in an array "exampleArray"?

     System.out.println(exampleArray[4]);

19.) What are the two ways you can declare and initialize an array? Demonstrate both.

    int[] myArray = new int[8];

   1. int[] myArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};

   2. for(int i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++){
        myArray[i] = i;
    }

20.) How do you iterate through a multidimensional array?


    int[][] multiArray = {{3,4},{5,6}};

    for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++){
        for(int t = 0; t < 2; t++){

        System.out.println(multiArray[i][t]);

        }
        }


21.) What is the for-each loop used for?

    to print out every single value of an array

    for(int i : arrayname){
    System.out.println(i);
    }
