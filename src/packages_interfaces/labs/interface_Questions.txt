Answer the following questions:

1.) What is an interface?

its a pre-written shortversion of the wished class and method structure

2.) Why are interfaces implemented?

in order to make sure, all needed elements will be worked on

3.) What is the implement keyword used for?

to implement an interface, it will cause problems, if not all abstract methods and so on are really used f.e.


4.) How many interfaces can a class implement?

as many as one wants

5.) Write a simple interface with one method.

public interface Register{
    String nameIntake(){
    }
    }

6.) Think of a real world application where interfaces are used. Describe it's purpose.

when someone builds an app and wants to make sure, that all the needed methods and classes will be used
so the structure will be build first, from someone, who has the overview of the whole application

7.) What is wrong with the following interface?

    public interface IncorrectInterface{
        int sum(int x, int y){
            return x + y;
        }
    }

    interfaces contain only abstract methods , empty ones
    the body is done after implmentation of them
