Answer the following questions:

1.) What is inheritance?

Inheritating means that from a parent class you creating like children classes. So we can build up a structure which is
connected with each other, where it needs to be.
They will inherit the methods and instance variables, as long as they are not private

2.) Why do we use inheritance?

there are often different categories of things, objects inside one category, in order to group similar ones together we
use inheritance; its also done to avoid recurrent codes

3.) Provide a real world example where you think inheritance would be implemented.

for example if you build a class for fruits, you will also creat subclasses, which may be stonefruits or cactusfruits,
but you will want to inherit all the characteristics, which belong to all of them

4.) How does a class inherit another class?

by using the keyword 'extends'

5.) How many levels can a hierarchy extend?

endless, but one class can only extend one other class

6.) What is the "super" keyword used for?

to refer to the parent class, and using its constructor  (?)

7.) When a subclass object is created, in what order do the constructors execute?

the parentclass constructor is always created first (?)

8.) What is method overwriting?

when you want to adapt a method you can overwrite a method, the name, the datatype stays the same,
but what happens inside the method, is different

9.) How can method overwriting be beneficial?

some fruits for example have different ways of molding, so this could be adapted in the subclasses as needed, using the
keyword lets you know, as soon as you may have made some change which leeds to not overwriting
